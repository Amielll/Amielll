- 👋 Hi, I’m Amiel Nurja (@Amielll) and am currently a second year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
- 👀 I’m particularly interested in backend development and artificial intelligence, but have a general interest in computer science as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data structures, algorithms, and operating systems in school. Outside of class I've been spending time learning TypeScript and how to build web applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project to further hone my TypeScript skills or one that involves AI/ML.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me via email at amiel.nurja@mail.utoronto.ca or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/amiel-nurja-b2816617a/.
